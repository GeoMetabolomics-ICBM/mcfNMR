COLMAR results with parameters
ppm H: 0.04
ppm C: 0.3
Matching ratio: 0.6

The deep picker peak (N907(dp)_hsqc.txt and N926(dp)_hsqc.txt) lists were picked automatically from the grid spectra provided by MetaboMiner and then referenced with all components that were recognized when matching the unreferenced list. This resulted in the following adjustments:

N907 (referenced to leucine, glucose, and lactic acid):
1H: 0.00937
13C: -0.2825

N926 (referenced to alanine, leucine, glucose, and lactic acid):
1H: -0.0227
13C: -0.14613
