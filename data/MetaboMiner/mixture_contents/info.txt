The original information of compounds contained in each mixture was obtained from the supplemental material to [Xia et al. (2008) BMC Bioinformatics]:

The compound names in this file were copied into the text files "<MIX-ID>.txt" and automatically converted to HMDB-ID lists ("<MIX-ID>_HMDB.txt") by running
    
    python map_to_HMDB_IDs.py

in this directory. Note that this script requires the python package 'editdistance', which can be installed via

   pip install editdistance
