The tests expect to find our inhouse dataset in this directory. It consists of the full spectra of all OLDB mixtures
in the subdirectory 'fullspectra', an example 1D spectrum in the folder 'test1D' and a database of peak lists for 
individual compound spectra. The dataset can be downloaded at: https://zenodo.org/records/14864750

This can be automated by running 

> source scripts/download_demodata.sh oldb

in the MCFNMR_HOME directory.
