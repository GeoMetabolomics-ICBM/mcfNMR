The benchmark table was extracted from Table 2 of Kim et al. (2022), doi: 10.1002/mrc.5240

The predicted compound list for sample N926 (see data/MetaboMiner) was generated by running SMART-Miner on N926_hsqc.csv (which is just a reformatted version of data/MetaboMiner/examples/peaklist/N926_hsqc.txt). The github page for SMART-Miner is https://github.com/ChungmaruQ/SMART-Miner, which links to a google Colab Notebook, where one can analyse peaklists with SMART-Miner:

The notebook is somewhat outdated an does not work with the most current versions of its dependencies but does not state, which versions were used. I managed to run it by copying the notebook and changing the bokeh.figure() parameter names plot_width and plot_height to simply width and height.
