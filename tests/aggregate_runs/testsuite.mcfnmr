# Attention: If a first pass, where new data is generated, fails. Run these tests a second time - approved results assume existing data.
assignment_radius_scans

# Runs the comparison of MCF method setups A, B, C, and D with MM, COLMAR, and SMART-Miner.
# Results for the MCF should be generated first via assignment_range_scans.
comparison_classification

# Runs the comparison of MCF method setups A, B, and C for the different experiments
comparison_quantification_full

# Runs the comparison of MCF method setups A, B, and C for the different experiments and plot out the barplots comparing expected and detected concentrations for each experiment at radii 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2
comparison_quantification_plot_single_stats

# Runs the comparison of different methods on the plasma samples N926 and N907
plasma_sample_analysis

# Runs the comparison of different methods on the plasma samples N926 and N907 using the smaller lib "plasma (common)" from the MetaboMiner suite
